# TinyApp - by Ghabe Bossin

<!---...(aka make links smol)-->
This is the first solo project in the Lighthouse Labs Web Developer bootcamp.

## Project Description

### Goal

This four-day project will have you building a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

You will build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way you'll get introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and you'll also learn more about Express, a web framework which is very popular in the Node community.

### Functional Requirements

#### User Stories

As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links,
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.

### Expected Usage

The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

##### Personal Notes

* I used an npm package for key generation found here (randomString):
